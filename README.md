## The repository

The IXIAN GitHub project is divided into seven main parts:

* [Ixian-Core](https://github.com/ProjectIxian/Ixian-Core): Functionality common to all other projects.
* [Ixian-DLT](https://github.com/ProjectIxian/Ixian-DLT): Implementation of the blockchain-processing part (the Master Node software).
* [Ixian-S2](https://github.com/ProjectIxian/Ixian-S2): Implementation of the streaming network (the S2 Node software).
* [SPIXI](https://github.com/ProjectIxian/SPIXI): Implementation of the SPIXI messaging client for Windows, Android and iOS.
* [Ixian-Miner](https://github.com/ProjectIxian/Ixian-Miner): Implementation of the Ixian standalone mining software.
* [Ixian-LiteWallet](https://github.com/ProjectIxian/Ixian-LiteWallet): Simple CLI wallet for the Ixian DLT network.
* [Ixian-Pool](https://github.com/ProjectIxian/Ixian-Pool): Mining pool software.

## Development branches

There are two main development branches:
* master: This branch is used to build the binaries for the official IXIAN DLT network. It should change slowly and be quite well-tested. This is also the default branch for anyone who wishes to build their Ixian software from source.
* development: This is the main development branch and the source for testnet binaries. The branch might not always be kept bug-free, if an extensive new feature is being worked on. If you are simply looking to build a current testnet binary yourself, please use one of the release tags which will be associated with the master branch.

## Documentation

You can find documentation on how to build, APIs and other documents on (https://docs.ixian.io).
